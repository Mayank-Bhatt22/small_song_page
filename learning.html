            It’s making you cry every time you give your love to me this way
            Saying you’d wait for me to stay, I know it hurts you,
            But I need to tell you something
            My heart just can’t be faithful for long
            I swear I’ll only make you cry
            
            Maybe I’d change for you someday, but I can’t help the way I feel
            Wish I was good, wish that I could give you my love now…
